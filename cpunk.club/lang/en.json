      "title": "1. Introduction",
      "subtitle1": "1.1 The Need for Community-Centric Projects",
      "paragraph1": "ChipPunk (CPUNK) is a community-driven meme token built on the Cellframe blockchain. It addresses common concerns of early-stage blockchain projectsâ€”inequitable token distribution, stealth development funds, and large investor dominanceâ€”by ensuring 100% community ownership. All CPUNK tokens enter the market transparently, without any developer or VC allocations.",
      "paragraph2": "This approach fosters organic growth and trust by allowing community members to shape the project's direction through open governance and a fair token release schedule. By operating on Cellframe's quantum-safe network, CPUNK aligns community-driven principles with cutting-edge blockchain infrastructure.",
      "subtitle2": "1.2 Why Cellframe?",
      "paragraph3": "Cellframe offers a quantum-resistant architecture designed to thwart emerging threats posed by quantum computing. Its scalable Global Database (GDB) underpins CPUNK's token economy and ensures users can transact, vote, and interact securely well into the quantum era. CPUNK takes advantage of Cellframe's DEX for transparent price discovery and seamless token trades."

      "investorsValue": "0%",
      "subtitle2": "2.2 Distribution Model",
      "paragraph1": "CPUNK will launch on the Cellframe DEX in 10 distinct orders, each representing 10% of the total supply (100M tokens/order). The initial order is set at 1 CPUNK = 0.0001 CELL, with subsequent orders priced 10% higher than the previous.",
      "paragraph2": "By releasing two orders per week over five weeks, the entire 1B supply will be distributed, ensuring a fair entry for early participants, transparent incremental price discovery, and a steady flow of tokens to the market.",
      "subtitle3": "2.3 Use of Funds",
      "paragraph3": "A significant portion of proceeds from CPUNK's token distribution will fund the first Cellframe community party on July 12, 2025â€”scheduled to celebrate the Cellframe mainnet's birthday. The event is capped at 1,000 attendees, each required to hold at least 1 million CPUNK to participate, with free entrance, food, and drinks."
    },
    "section3": {
      "title": "3. Governance Model",
      "subtitle1": "3.1 Community Proposals",
      "paragraph1": "CPUNK embraces decentralized decision-making with a system wherein any holder above a set threshold can submit proposals. During the defined voting window, token holders vote in proportion to their holdings. Proposals that pass are executed on-chain (once Cellframe fully supports complex smart contracts), ensuring trustless implementation.",
      "subtitle2": "3.2 Transparency & Accountability",
      "paragraph2": "All critical financial and developmental decisions reside on-chain, tied to immutable smart contracts. CPUNK's open-source codebase welcomes ongoing review and collaboration from the community, reinforcing its commitment to accountability and collective governance."
    },
    "section4": {
      "title": "4. Conclusion",
      "paragraph1": "ChipPunk (CPUNK) demonstrates the power of a wholly community-driven token in a rapidly advancing blockchain ecosystem. By aligning fair, transparent distribution with quantum-resistant security, CPUNK exemplifies best practices in decentralized finance and community building.",
      "paragraph2": "Join us in celebrating blockchain innovation and shaping the future of quantum-safe digital economies. Stay tuned for the inaugural CPUNK-driven Cellframe community party on July 12, 2025â€”a real-world event marking Cellframe's mainnet birthday and a landmark occasion for the entire CPUNK community."
