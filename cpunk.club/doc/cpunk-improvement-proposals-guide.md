# CPUNK Improvement Proposals (CIPs) Guide

## Overview

The CPUNK Improvement Proposals (CIPs) system is a formal process for community members to propose changes to the CPUNK ecosystem. This includes protocol modifications, governance changes, feature enhancements, and strategic initiatives. CIPs provide a structured approach for suggesting, discussing, reviewing, and implementing important ecosystem improvements.

## Accessing the CIPs System

The CIPs system is accessible at [https://cpunk.club/proposals.html](https://cpunk.club/proposals.html). Anyone can browse and review proposals without needing to connect to the Cellframe Dashboard. However, connecting to the dashboard and selecting a wallet is required for voting on active proposals.

## CIP Statuses

CIPs can exist in the following statuses:

1. **Draft**: Initial proposal stage, open for community feedback and refinement
2. **Under Vote**: Proposal is currently being voted on by the community
3. **Approved**: Proposal has passed the voting process and is approved for implementation
4. **Rejected**: Proposal did not receive sufficient support during voting
5. **Implemented**: Proposal has been fully implemented in the CPUNK ecosystem

## Proposal Structure

A standard CIP follows this structure:

- **CIP Number**: Sequential identifier (CIP-X)
- **Title**: Concise description of the proposal
- **Status**: Current stage in the proposal lifecycle
- **Type**: Category that best describes the proposal (e.g., Network Infrastructure, Token Economics)
- **Category**: More specific classification
- **Voting Period**: Timeframe for community voting (if applicable)
- **Abstract**: Brief summary of the proposal (1-2 paragraphs)
- **Motivation**: Problem statement and why this change is necessary
- **Details**: Comprehensive description of the proposal, including technical specifications
- **Benefits**: Expected advantages and improvements
- **Next Steps**: Action items and implementation plan

## Proposal Workflow

1. **Creation**: Proposals are drafted and submitted by community members or the CPUNK team
2. **Review**: Community provides feedback on draft proposals
3. **Refinement**: Proposal author updates based on feedback
4. **Voting**: Eligible community members vote on finalized proposals
5. **Implementation**: Approved proposals are developed and deployed
6. **Closure**: Proposal is marked as implemented or rejected

## Voting on Proposals

To vote on active proposals:

1. Navigate to the proposals page at [https://cpunk.club/proposals.html](https://cpunk.club/proposals.html)
2. Connect to your Cellframe Dashboard by clicking the "Connect" button
3. Select your wallet from the list of available wallets
4. Browse to the proposal you wish to vote on and select it
5. Choose your voting option: Support, Oppose, or Abstain
6. Confirm your vote

Note that voting requires a connected wallet with $CPUNK tokens. Your voting power is proportional to your token holdings.

## Filtering and Sorting

The CIPs interface offers several filtering and sorting options:

- **Filter by Status**: View proposals in specific stages (Draft, Under Vote, Approved, etc.)
- **Sort by**: Arrange proposals by date (newest/oldest) or by proposal number

## Creating a New Proposal

Currently, proposal creation is managed by the CPUNK team. If you have an idea for a new proposal, please reach out through official communication channels:

- [Telegram](https://t.me/chippunk_official)
- [Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/OfficialCpunk)
- Email: proposals@cpunk.club

Future updates will include a direct proposal submission interface for community members.

## Governance Model

The CPUNK governance model follows these principles:

1. **Transparency**: All proposals are publicly accessible
2. **Community-driven**: Decisions are made through token-weighted voting
3. **Inclusivity**: All stakeholders are encouraged to participate
4. **Accountability**: Implementation progress is regularly reported

## Example: CIP-1

CIP-1 proposes migrating the $CPUNK ecosystem from the Cellframe Backbone Network to a dedicated $CPUNK Parachain. Key points include:

- Moving the DNA system to enhance data control and security
- Using Global Database (GDB) as a cache for improved performance
- Enabling advanced features like native NFT support
- Establishing validator structures and reward mechanisms

This proposal demonstrates the format and scope of a comprehensive CIP.

## Technical Implementation

The CIPs system is integrated with the CPUNK platform's dashboard connector and wallet selection mechanisms. Voting records are stored on-chain to ensure transparency and immutability.

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements to the CIPs system include:

1. Direct proposal submission interface
2. Enhanced discussion features
3. Real-time voting statistics
4. Implementation tracking
5. Notification system for proposal updates
